# Common Voice Sentence Collector

The [Sentence Collector](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/sentence-collector/) is part of the [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/) project. Its purpose is to provide a tool for contributors to upload public domain sentences, which then can get reviewed and are exported to the Common Voice database. Once imported they will show up for contributors on Common Voice to read out aloud.

## Get involved

- Fork the project and test that you can run the environment locally following the instructions below.
- Is everything working as expected? If not, submit [a new issue](https://github.com/Common-Voice/sentence-collector/issues/new).
- Review the pending issues in the [project](https://github.com/Common-Voice/sentence-collector/projects/2).
- Create a [new PR](https://github.com/Common-Voice/sentence-collector/compare) to fix any of the existing issues in the project.
- To add or adjust validation and cleanup for a language see [VALIDATION.md](https://github.com/common-voice/sentence-collector/blob/main/server/lib/validation/VALIDATION.md) and [CLEANUP.md](https://github.com/common-voice/sentence-collector/blob/main/server/lib/cleanup/CLEANUP.md). Cleanup is optional and should only be used in rare cases.

## Prerequisites

 * [Node >= 12.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 * [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
 * [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Architecture

![Diagram](architecture.svg)

To edit this diagram, load the `architecture.svg` in the root of the repository into [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) and then save the updated version back into the repository like any other file changes you'd make.

## Local Development

Start the MySQL database:

```
docker-compose up
```

Now we can install the dependencies:

```
npm run install:all
```

Start the server in a new terminal window. For this you'll need parameters from Auth0 to make sure that the login works, see below for a short tutorial.

```
cd server
npm run migrate
env AUTH0_DOMAIN=yourusername.eu.auth0.com AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=fromauth0 AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=fromauth0 SESSION_SECRET=somerandomvalue npm start
```

Finally, you can start the frontend in another terminal window. Please make sure that you're in the root directory of the repository.

```
cd web
npm start
```

The sentence collector is now accessible through `http://localhost:3333`. We're serving the frontend code through the NodeJS app to make Auth0 work locally. However the frontend code changes are still rebuilt, so you can reload the tab to see changes.

## Getting required parameters from Auth0

1. Create an [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) account. There is a free tier and that will be enough for local development.
2. Click "Applications" from the dashboard. Create a new one, or use the default application.
3. Go to "Applications" and click on the Settings icon next to your application.
4. Add `http://localhost:3333/sentence-collector/callback` to the "Allowed Callback URLs" list.
5. You can add more login options to your app from the "Connections" tab, but you don't have to
6. These required domain, client ID and client secret are found in the same Settings tab as the "Allowed Callback URLs". Copy those into your run command from above.
7. You will now be able to create a new user by clicking on "Login" and then switching over to the "Sign Up" tab on the login dialog. You don't need to use a valid email address.

## Running automated tests

### Backend

Running the unit and integration tests:

```
cd server
npm t
```

### Frontend

Running the unit tests:

```
cd web
npm t
```

If you need to update the snapshots, run `npm t -- -u`, but make sure that the new snapshots indeed match the expected outcome.

## Path special cases

* In production the app is mounted at `/sentence-collector`
* Therefore we need to make sure that we're not requesting resources on `/`
* This however leads to a weirder case locally, as we're faking this relationship.
* We do not want to build the base path into the image, which does not leave us many possibilities. Injecting it into the running container is a possibility, but makes it quite complicated for the frontend calls.
* Therefore we are serving the frontend on `/` locally, and the API lives at `/sentence-collector`
* With that we have the same relative calls as we have in production
* Apart from having a prefix that is either empty or not, we do not have any other special casing

## Exporting to the official repository

You don't need to manually export the sentences from the Sentence Collector to the Common Voice repository. This is done automatically once a week: https://github.com/common-voice/sentence-collector/actions?query=workflow%3Aexport

However, if you have a need to do it, use the following procedure:

This will export all the approved sentences for languages currently active in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/common-voice/main/locales/all.json and put them into `sentence-collector.txt` files in the corresponding locale folder of the Common Voice repository.

1. Make sure you have forked the common-voice repo to your user.
2. Clone common-voice locally and link your remote fork for exports

```
git clone https://github.com/mozilla/common-voice.git
cd common-voice
git remote add fork git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/common-voice.git
```

All steps to do the export to our fork (you can repeat this each time you want to make an updated export)

```
cd common-voice
## Making sure our main branch is updated
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git push fork main
git push --delete fork sentence-collector-export
git branch -D sentence-collector-export
## Creating a new branch just for exports
git checkout -b sentence-collector-export
cd ..
## Creating the export
env API_BASE_URL=https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/sentence-collector/ COMMON_VOICE_PATH=common-voice node scripts/exporter.js
## Committing the export to our fork
cd common-voice
git add .
git commit -am "Sentence Collector - Validated sentences export - 2019-02-13"
git push fork sentence-collector-export
```

Now you will be able to create a manual pull request using the following URL:

``https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/common-voice/pull/new/sentence-collector-export``

## Useful queries

### Get all approved sentences

```
SELECT
      Sentences.id,
      Sentences.sentence,
      Sentences.localeId,
      SUM(Votes.approval) as number_of_approving_votes
    FROM Sentences
    LEFT JOIN Votes ON (Votes.sentenceId=Sentences.id)
    GROUP BY Sentences.id
    HAVING
      number_of_approving_votes >= 2;
```

### Get not decided sentences

```
SELECT
      Sentences.id,
      Sentences.sentence,
      Sentences.localeId,
      SUM(Votes.approval) as number_of_approving_votes,
      COUNT(Votes.approval) as number_of_votes
    FROM Sentences
    LEFT JOIN Votes ON (Votes.sentenceId=Sentences.id)
    GROUP BY Sentences.id
    HAVING
      number_of_votes < 2 OR # not enough votes yet
      number_of_votes = 2 AND number_of_approving_votes = 1; # a tie at one each
```

### Get all decided

```
SELECT Sentences.*
    FROM Sentences
    LEFT JOIN Votes ON (Votes.sentenceId=Sentences.id)
    GROUP BY Sentences.id
    HAVING
      COUNT(Votes.approval) >= 2;
```

### Get all rejected

```
SELECT Sentences.*
    FROM Sentences
    LEFT JOIN Votes ON (Votes.sentenceId=Sentences.id)
    GROUP BY Sentences.id
    HAVING
      (
        COUNT(Votes.approval) = 3 AND
        SUM(Votes.approval) < 2
      ) OR (
        COUNT(Votes.approval) = 2 AND
        SUM(Votes.approval) = 0
      );
```
