sc-home-title = Welcome to the Common Voice Sentence Collector
sc-home-intro = The Sentence Collector is part of <commonVoiceLink>Common Voice</commonVoiceLink>. It allows contributors to collect and validate sentences created by the community. You can use this tool also to import and clean-up small-to-medium-sized public domain corpus you have found or collected. All sentences need to be Public Domain. Approved sentences are exported every week to the Common Voice repository and are released on the Common Voice website on every new deployment.
sc-home-collect-title = Collect sentences
sc-home-collect-text = Help us by writing or collecting Public Domain sentences.
sc-home-review-title = Review sentences
sc-home-review-text = Help us by reviewing sentences for correctness according to the guidelines.

sc-howto-title = How to
sc-howto-addlang-title = Adding languages to work with
sc-howto-addlang-text = Once logged in you can select your languages from the profile section.
sc-howto-addsen-title = Add new sentences
sc-howto-addsen-item-1 = All sentences you submit must be under <wikipediaLink>Public Domain (CC-0) license</wikipediaLink>. To support the inclusion of work not under public licence, we have created a <cc0WaiverLink>Contributions Agreement template</cc0WaiverLink> for works where the copyright owner would like to contribute the material to Common Voice.
sc-howto-addsen-item-2 = Numbers. There should be no digits in the source text because they can cause problems when read aloud. The way a number is read depends on context and might introduce confusion in the dataset. For example, the number “2409” could be accurately read as both “twenty-four zero nine” and “two thousand four hundred nine”.
sc-howto-addsen-item-3 = Abbreviations and Acronyms. Abbreviations and acronyms like “USA” or “ICE” should be avoided in the source text because they may be read in a way that does not coincide with their spelling. Additionally, there may be multiple accurate readings for a single abbreviation. For example, the acronym “ICE” could be pronounced “I-C-E” or as a single word.
sc-howto-addsen-item-4 = Punctuation. Special symbols and punctuation should only be included when absolutely necessary. For example, an apostrophe is included in English words like “don’t” and “we’re” and should be included in the source text, but it’s unlikely you’ll ever need a special symbol like “@” or “#.”
sc-howto-addsen-item-5 = Foreign letters. Letters must be valid in the language being spoken. For example, “ж” is a letter in the Russian alphabet but is never used in English and so should never appear in any English source text.
sc-howto-addsen-item-6 = Languages can have their <validationRulesLink>own validation rules</validationRulesLink> with additional requirements. If there is no specific validation file for a language, we are using the generic English rules.
sc-howto-addsen-post-1 = We prefer natural/conversational sentences. While phonetic diversity and different words in sentences is important, we are trying to make recording sentences as much fun as possible. Therefore it would be great if you could try to keep your sentences as natural/engaging as possible.
sc-howto-cite-title = How to Cite
sc-howto-cite-pre-1 = It's important that you reference where you found the public licence to avoid plagiarism and to allow for follow ups on <copyrightIssuesLink>copyright issues</copyrightIssuesLink>. Here are a few ways you can cite the work.
sc-howto-cite-item-1 = You could include the website, e.g "Common Voice - https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/"
sc-howto-cite-item-2 = You could use academic referencing style, e.g Harvard style "Mozilla (2021) Common Voice. Available at https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/ (Accessed: 15th September 2021)"
sc-howto-cite-item-3 = For public domain text not available online, you could use academic referencing style e.g Harvard style "Jess (2021) My Public licence poems"
sc-howto-review-title = Review Sentences
sc-howto-review-subtitle = Make sure the sentence meets the following criteria:
sc-howto-review-criteria-1 = The sentence must be spelled correctly.
sc-howto-review-criteria-2 = The sentence must be grammatically correct.
sc-howto-review-criteria-3 = The sentence must be speakable.
sc-howto-review-criteria-4 = If the sentence meets the criteria, click the "Approve" button.
sc-howto-review-criteria-5 = If the sentence does not meet the above criteria, click the "Reject" button. If you are unsure about the sentence, you may also skip it and move on to the next one.
sc-howto-review-criteria-6 = If you run out of sentences to review, please help us collect more sentences!
sc-howto-findpd-title = Finding existing sentences in the Public Domain
sc-howto-findpd-subtitle = Search for them on the Internet
sc-howto-findpd-text = Remember that we need permission to publish those sentences, so always ensure that the text belongs to the <wikipediaLink>public domain</wikipediaLink>. If there is not an indication, reach out to the person that the text belongs to and ask if you can use their text.
sc-howto-findpd-tips = Here are some tips to find sentences:
sc-howto-findpd-tips-1 = The best sources you can look for are podcasts, transcripts, movie scripts and anything that potential can contain everyday conversations.
sc-howto-findpd-tips-2 = Government proceedings, books and articles are also great however since the text tends to be a little more formal they are less of a priority.
sc-howto-findpd-tips-3 = Unfortunately we can’t have Wikimedia articles yet. So do not copy paste from there.
sc-howto-findpd-subtitle-2 = Partner with local organizations or individuals
sc-howto-findpd-partner-1 = There are a lot of public organizations that might want to collaborate and already have a lot of texts they can donate as public domain. Reach out to local universities, Governments and open source organizations to talk about the project and ask for their help.
sc-howto-findpd-partner-2 = Expert linguists can also help, try to reach out to local linguistic universities (both teachers and students) and see if they can help to gather a diverse set of sound-diverse sentences in your language.
