      . It allows contributors to collect and validate sentences created by the community. You can use this tool also to import and clean-up small-to-medium-sized public domain corpus you have found or collected. All sentences need to be Public Domain. Approved sentences are exported every week to the Common Voice repository and are released on the Common Voice website on every new deployment.
